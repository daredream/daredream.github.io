## Some notes and quotes

Considering some of the more functional programming concepts/techniques,
starting with *.map*, *.reduce*, *.filter*.

> Declarative programming is "the act of programming in languages 
> that conform to the mental model of the developer rather than the 
> operational model of the machine".

> Declarative property is where there can exist only one possible set 
> of statements that can express each specific modular semantic.The 
> imperative property is the dual, where semantics are inconsistent 
> under composition and/or can be expressed with variations of sets 
> of statements.

> Declarative languages contrast with imperative languages which 
> specify explicit manipulation of the computerâ€™s internal state; 
> or procedural languages which specify an explicit sequence of steps 
> to follow.

> In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm 
> that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its 
> control flow.
