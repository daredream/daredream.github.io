# Explorations in GraphQL

After exploring a bit of what it takes to integrate ReactJS and 
Wordpress, and after having taken a look at d3.js, I will be 
learning another Facebook technology, namely, GraphQL, and seeing
how the syntax integrates with ReactJS (and then possibly
Wordpress or Ruby on Rails).

A working example/starting point:

    var { graphql, buildSchema  } = require('graphql');

    var schema = buildSchema(`
        type Query {
            hello: String
              
        }
        `);
        
        var root = { hello: () => 'Hello world!'  };
        
    graphql(schema, '{ hello  }', root).then((response) => {
       console.log(response);

    });`
   `)
