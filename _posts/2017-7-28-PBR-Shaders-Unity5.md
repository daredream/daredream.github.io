# Detour into 3D Game Engines

Now for a little detour from the beaten path of Javascript, ReactJS, etc.
into the also very popular Unity3D ecosystem, a very technical topic--
shaders!

[Unity 5.x PBR Lux Shaders](https://github.com/larsbertram69/Lux-2.02-Personal)

> Lux is a (mostly...) open source shader framework built upon unityâ€™s rendering and shading pipeline. It adds advanced lighting features such as area lights, translucent and skin lighting and allows you to 
> easily use effects like dynamic weather, mix mapping or parallax occlusion mapping.
>
> Lux has been built having deferred rendering in mind. So you will have to face some limitations as far as you material definitions are concerned as lux aims to be efficient rather than make everything possible.
>
> Lux ships with a standard shader which will allow you to use and adjust most features simply using the material editor. However getting most out of it you may consider writing your own surface shaders. 
> In order to make this as easy as possible the framework ships with a bunch of includes and shader macro definitions which should do most of the work that is needed to make everything work.
